An exceptional design and build service for your London garden
Kate Eyre Garden Design is one of London’s leading garden designers and has been creating outstanding bespoke gardens for more than a decade. We are dedicated to making stunning, life-enhancing outside spaces for our clients – beautiful, usable, with a strong sense of colour and style, and for a wide range of properties and budgets.
Our planting is original and exemplary, and designed to stimulate your senses throughout the year. We are passionate in our belief that the style of your garden should reflect that of your house, so that life may flow easily from one to the other.
We deliver a comprehensive garden service, from design, construction and planting, through to completion. This ensures clear communication between our design and build teams, and tight management of your project throughout. Together we will be focused on making your desired garden a reality.
Your garden design
We will accompany you along every step of the process of designing your garden.
The project will begin with us meeting you to discuss your intended use of the garden, and your desired look and level of maintenance. We will also show you examples of our previous gardens, as your feedback will help us to understand your tastes and preferences.
Site survey
The next step is for us to survey your garden. This will include taking measurements of your property and level differences, along with reviewing any trees to retain or remove.
The design
We will then create two unique designs for your garden. Each one will include a coloured master plan along with a planting moodboard and material moodboard. You may select either of these two proposals, or you may wish to combine aspects of each. We will make any changes necessary to meet your requirements.
Costing
Once the design of your future garden has been finalised, we will provide you with an itemised quote breaking down the full cost of building and planting your garden.
We have a proven track record of high-quality garden design in London. See some gardens we have created previously via our portfolio below.
